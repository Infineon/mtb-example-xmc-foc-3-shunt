Phase V  | V (J5)
Phase W  | W (J6)

<br>


## Basic operations

### Motor control operation

- Change the control scheme, define the `USER_FOC_CTRL_SCHEME` macro to either (SPEED_INNER_CURRENT_CTRL) or (VQ_VOLTAGE_CTRL) in the *user_input_config.h* file. For example:
  
   ```
   #define USER_FOC_CTRL_SCHEME   SPEED_INNER_CURRENT_CTRL // Sets to speed control mode
   ```
   or

   ```
   #define USER_FOC_CTRL_SCHEME   VQ_VOLTAGE_CTRL      // Sets to voltage control mode
   ```

- Enable onboard potentiometer control for motor start/stop and target setting. Motor direction is controlled by the direction switch on the board (SW1).

- To enable the motor control with the potentiometer, define the `USER_REF_SETTING` macro as `(ENABLED)` in *user_input_config.h*. For example:

   ```
   #define USER_REF_SETTING         (ENABLED) // Enables onboard potentiometer control
   ```

- To disable motor control with the potentiometer, define the `USER_REF_SETTING` macro as `(DISABLED)` in the *user_input_config.h* file. For example:

   ```
   #define USER_REF_SETTING         (DISABLED) // Disables onboard potentiometer control
   ```
  When potentiometer control is disabled, motor start/stop and target setting change are controlled through a variable write:

  - To start the motor:
    
    ```
    PMSM_FOC_MotorStart();                   // Sets motor_start flag
    ADC.adc_res_pot = 2048;                  // Sets adc_res_pot to 2048 = 50% nominal speed (speed mode) or 50% duty cycle (voltage mode)
    ```
  - To stop the motor:
    
    ```
    ucProbe_cmd = 16;  // Sets motor stop command
    ```
    
  Scaling of `ADC.adc_res_pot` is Q12(4096=1PU), which means that `ADC.adc_res_pot` at the max value is 4096.

  - In voltage control mode, the torque Vq `PMSM_FOC_INPUT.ref_vq` controls the output duty cycle (32768 = 100% output duty cycle).

  - In speed control mode, the reference speed `PMSM_FOC_INPUT.ref_speed`  controls the motor speed (32768 = motor maximum speed); the actual motor speed can be read from the `PMSM_FOC_OUTPUT.rotor_speed` variable.

- The fault status can be read from `MotorVar.error_status` (unmasked faults) or `MotorVar.MaskedFault` (masked faults). Bitfields set in `MotorVar.error_status` mean that faults are present. Control will enter the FAULT state only if the fault is enabled and the bitfields are set in the `MotorVar.MaskedFault` masked fault variable. In other words, only an enabled fault can trigger the state machine to enter the FAULT status. In firmware, the masked fault is calculated as follows:

   ```
   MotorVar.MaskedFault.Value = MotorVar.error_status & MotorParam.EnableFault
   ```
- A fault can be enabled/disabled by setting/clearing the corresponding bit in the `MotorParam.EnableFault` parameter. Its value is calculated by the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI.

- To clear the fault, do one of the following:

   - **Option 1:** Write `ucProbe_cmd` to '3'. After this command is received, the firmware will write `MotorVar.fault_clear` to '1'.

     ```
     ucProbe_cmd = 3;  // Control word 3: clear fault. Firmware will then set `MotorVar.fault_clear` to '1' after receiving this control word command
     ```

  - **Option 2** (Preferred): Directly write `MotorVar.fault_clear` to '1'.
  
    ```
    MotorVar.fault_clear = 1;                     // Directly sets the clear fault flag
    ```
- The detected faults will be stored in a different bit position of the 'MotorVar.error_status' variable. E.g., a '1' at bit 12 position indicates nFault from MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7141 or MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7151 detected, a '1' at bit 10 position indicates DC link undervoltage detected, a '1' at bit 4 position indicates DC link overvoltage detected.
- Board temperature from MCP9700 is sampled, filtered, and converted to degree celsius. To read the board temperature:
  
   ```
   int degreeC_x16 = MotorVar.t_sensor;  // Degree celsius temperature in Q4, 16 counts = 1Â°C e.g., 0 = 0Â°C, 160 = 10Â°C, 320 = 20Â°C
   ```

### Managing the parameters

There are two types of parameters:

- **User input:** User input parameters are usually presented in engineering units (volt, amps, RPM, etc.) which can be configured based on the application requirements.

- **Internal parameters:** Internal parameters are actual parameters that are being used by the firmware. Most internal parameters use different scaling to ensure efficient code execution and cannot be easy to be understood.

One key feature of the Motor Control GUI is the ability to calculate the internal parameter from the user input parameter. A conversion function is available in the firmware.

In the firmware, user inputs are `#define` in the *Configuration/pmsm_foc_user_input_config.h* header file; the conversion function is in the C source file, *ToolInterface/Register.c*.

All internal parameters related to motor control are grouped in the `MotorParam` data structure; configure this structure correctly before the motor could run. Use the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI to enter the user input and let the tool calculate the internal parameter value, and then click **Write Parameter** to write all internal parameters into the MCU's RAM. After completing this step, the motor should be ready to run.

You can save the parameters into the MCU so that the next time when the board powers up, the motor is ready to run immediately. A location inside the MCU's flash memory is designated for storing the internal parameters. Click **Write to Flash** in the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI to store the internal parameters into the flash memory.

All MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7141 or MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7151 config registers are handled in a similar way.

To write both `MotorParam` and `Edl7141Reg` into the flash, set the control word to '4':

```
ucProbe_cmd = 4;    // Control word 4: program parameter RAM value into flash memory
```


### Using the oscilloscope

Scope traces are selected in the oscilloscope tool of the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI.


### Controlling MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7141, MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7151 smart gate driver, and MOTIX&trade; IMD700A motor controller

The EN_DRV pin output level ('1' or '0') from XMC1400 MCU is controlled by `EdlIo.en_drv_level`. Note that the motor state machine controls the EN_DRV pin in some state changes; the EN_DRV pin control is valid only if there is no motor control state change.

The nBrake pin output level ('1' or '0') from XMC1400 MCU is controlled by `EdlIo.nbrake_level`. Note that the nBrake pin control is independent of motor control.

> **Note:** EN_DRV and nBrake control are only for testing the MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7141 and MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7151 smart gate driver function. If nBrake is set to a low level manually while the motor is running, it can cause faults such as stall error. In such cases, set nBrake to a high level, clear the fault, and verify that the motor is in â€˜STOPâ€™ state before running the motor again. Do not set EN_DRV to a low level while the motor is running.

DC calibration control can be turned on or off by writing '1' or '0' to the MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7141 or MOTIX&trade; 6ELD7151 configure register bitfield `CSAMP_CFG[11]`.

ADC input selection (Idigital/DVDD/VDDB) is written to the MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7141 or MOTIX&trade; 6ELD7151 configure register bitfield `ADC_CFG[2:1]`.

An ADC request is initiated by writing '1' to the MOTIX&trade; 6EDL7141 or MOTIX&trade; 6ELD7151 configure register bitfield `ADC_CFG[0]`.


## Firmware code overview

This firmware code example can integrate with the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI to provide an easy user configuration for the motor control system.

The code has stored most of the configurations in the `MotorParam` structure. Those parameters in this structure have internal scaling. The ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI is designed to take the user input (user input parameter) and convert it into internal parameter values in `MotorParam`. This means that these parameters can be changed without recompiling or reflashing the code.

If you choose not to use the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI for parameter configuration, this process can be simulated by taking the user input into *user_input_config.h* file, and then converting it into internal parameter values by using the `PROGRAM_DEFAULT_PARAM = 1` macro in *Makefile* file of the project. This macro will be used during code initialization; it initializes the parameters in the `MotorParam` structure into default values. These values can be changed by modifying the member values in the `MotorParam` structure directly.

A different control scheme can be switched at the motor stop state by changing the value in `MotorParam.ControlScheme`.

The fault bit in `error_status` will not cause a motor fault unless the corresponding bit in `MotorParam.EnableFault` is set. In other words, `error_status` is masked by `EnableFault`; if a fault is not enabled by the `EnableFault` bit, the fault will not put the motor control into the ERROR state.


### Resources and settings

The project uses the default *design.modus* file.


## Known limitations

This section lists the current known limitations of the system.


### Supported operating modes between the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI and code example

Currently, the following two modes of operations are supported in using the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI and the code example itself in source code form:

- **Using the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI**

   Use the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI for evaluation of the code example performance and tuning the parameters by flashing the board using the programming features of the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI. For this, supply both the HEX and ELF artifacts of the build to the tool following the on-screen prompts. Using this method, the tool will always overwrite the motor control parameters that are defined in the firmware source code. Therefore, editing of parameters is possible only through the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI.

   Use all ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI features to modify the parameters, control the motor, and observe the application performance. This option is intended for early evaluation of the related kit and firmware or for fine-tuning the motor control parameters in a graphical way.

- **Using the code example in source code form with ModusToolbox&trade;**

   If you use the code example in source code format and modify the parameters of the application, motor control, or MCU, compatibility with the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI cannot be guaranteed and can lead to unexpected behavior. This applies especially to modifying motor control parameters that are automatically overwritten in the tool as mentioned above. Use this option if you want to edit the firmware source code or tune the parameters in the source code.


### Oscillation in motor RPM against the set target

In normal operation with a running motor in speed control mode, the observable motor RPM can be slightly different from the specified target speed. This variation from the target speed is dependent on the PI tuning of the control loop and whether the motor is loaded or running free.

This code example is not fine-tuned for any specific motor. Fine-tuning of the motor control parameters can be done either in firmware or by using the ModusToolbox&trade; Motor Suite GUI.
